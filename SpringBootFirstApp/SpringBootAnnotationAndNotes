Spring boot annotation and notes 

1) @SpringBootApplication - Spring boot application startes with this annotated class.
2) @RestController - define that class as controller  - use @PathParam
3) @RequestMapping - map request with that class with defined name
4) @Service - This service annotated class will be treated as a service.
5) @PathVariable - To specify variable is taken from url path.
6) @RequestBody - to get body in POST request and convert it into required format/object
7) @Autowired - To inject object of perticular class.
8) @Controller - this is just a cotroller , dont means a rest controller. - use @PathVariable
9) @LoadBalence


-------------------------------------------------
Spring JPA

1) @Entity - This class considered as a table through spring JPA
2) @Table(name="tName") - table name is given by this annotation
3) @Id - primary key is marked with this annotation.
4) @Column(name="id") - column name and variable mapping is done through this annotation.
    ( if name of clmn and variable name is same then providing name is optional ) 
5)  @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO) - auto increament value of id using hibernate entity



-------------------------------------------------

1) Web service : a service on web for a machine consumption(software level communication).
2) Micro service : a micro service is a independant service within an application.
3) CRUD operation - creat , read , update , delete
4) extends CrudRepository<T, ID> - T : entity class - Post , ID : primary key data type - Integer
5) we dont need to implement any business logic inside this class for any CRUD operation , just by using object of this class and can 
	do operation with that.
6) Providing default constructor is compulsory for entity class otherwise it will create a exception.
7) save method will update the record if id already present otherwise it will create new row
8) spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update - update serves create and update both features.
9) url for spring boot application will be : http://localhost:8080/<url_pattern>
	no any further path will be there as server is inbuilt in this application.url will be based on base url.
10) Devtool - is the dependency added while creating a spring boot project,it helps in development.
	- using this devtool feature , whatever change we made in code just reflects directly without rerunning the application.
