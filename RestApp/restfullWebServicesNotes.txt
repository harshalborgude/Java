	RestFull web services 
=================================================================

1) two types of API : SOAP and REST , soap was old one and rest is new one ,
	soap supports only xml based data communication , rest supports json,xml,text any type of comunication.
2) Types of HTTP methods : GET , POST , PUT , DELETE
3) HTTP status codes : 200ok , 404 not found , 500 internal server error.
	1xx : Informational - request is recieved & process is continued. (100-server have recieved the request header and client should proceed for body ,
		102- server has recieved the request and processing the request)
	2xx : Successfull - successfully recieved , understood , and accepted the request. (200 ok - standard response for successful HTTP request)
	3xx : Redirectional - further action need to be taken to complete the request.
	4xx : Client Error - request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled. (403 Forbidden - request was valid but server is refusing - unauthorised ,
		404 Not Found - the requested resources could not be found but may be available in future)
	5xx : Server Error - server failed to fulfill an valid request. ( 500 Internal server error - generic server errorr msg , 503 service unavailable)
4) Types of URI's :
	i)   File based URI - travel.com/goa.html , travel.com/vegas.html
	ii)  Resource based links - travel.com/cities/{city_id}
	iii) Filter based URI's - travel.com/cities/startwith=m  , travel.com/cities/offset=25&limit=50

5) URI relationships : travel.com/countries/india/cities - here proper flow and relation is maintained
	- travel.com/cities/{id} - this kind of uri dont have proper relationship.
6) for update operation always use PUT method.
  - for Create operation use POST method.
7) Properties of RESTfull API :
   - URI
   - HTTP method 
   - HATEOAS capability.
8) Richardsons maturity model : this depends upon implementation of above properties
	- level 0 : not restfull
	- level 1/2 : partially restfull
	- level 3 : Fully restfull
9) Popular JAX-RS rest api implementation provider :
	- jersey
	- RESTeasy
	- Apache CFX
	- Restlet
