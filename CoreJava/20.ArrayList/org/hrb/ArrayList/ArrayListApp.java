//Collections Framework
//The collections framework is a set of useful interface and classes of use data structures such as a Map, List, etc.
//The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects.
//collection : List, Set, map, Queue, Deque, stack, etc.
//classes 	: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, ArrayList, LinkedList,HashMap, TreeMap, PriorityQueue,Vector(stack) , etc.

//List : ArrayList, LinkedList
// set :  HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
// map :  HashMap, LinkedHashMap,TreeMap
// Queue : LinkedBlockingQueue , ArrayBlockingQueue 
// Deque : LinkedBlockingDeque , ArrayBlockingDeque
// Stack : stack

//Collection framework is tested and optimized
//No third-party API required for accessing collection framework.


// Array List
// ArrayList in Java is used to store a collection of dynamic-sized elements. Unlike arrays that have a fixed size, an ArrayList automatically increases its size when new elements are added.
// ArrayList only accepts the elements that are objects of a class such as an Integer class or any class defined by the user, but not for any primitive data type
// to store the elements in an array dynamically we make use of ArrayList.
// An ArrayList is an object which can be a resizable array.
// It is an implementation of List interface where the elements can be dynamically added or removed from the List.
// add() method is used to add data in a newly created linked list.
// pros : Fast , Easy to access any element from any location
// cons : Operations are slow , Tends to use more memory while operating


//Linkedlist
//Here, every node is interconnected to the next node through a memory address link.
//This is one of the most useful data structures and highly used in real-world scenarios because of its high-speed capacity and fast addition and deletion. 
//This basic collection structure is the data in and the address which points to the next node functions as the guide of the respective node (That is the reason for it being called the Linked List).
//add() method is used to add data in a newly created linked list.

//List Interface
//The interface is an outline of the methods for a particular class to implement.
//List of countries is declared with List interface and later initialize with type ArrayList.

//Sets
//The sets are a unique type of data structure mostly used because it does not allow the repetition of the elements.
//elements are stored in the set using the add() method.
//Types of sets : linked set, hashed set, and tree set.
//HashSet uses the Hashing table,
//LinkedHashSet uses the Hashing table
//and LinkedList and TreeSet uses Tree for internal working.
//HashSet : doesn't guarantee order, allow one null key , faster for common operations like add , search , remove
//LinkedHashSet : it keep element in order they are added, speed comes after hashset
//TreeSet : It sorts all objects , doesn't allow null key , much slower bcz needs to perform sorting 

//Maps
//A map contains values based on the key, for example, key and value pair. 
//Each pair of key and value is known as an entry. Both the key and values are objects
//A map cannot contain duplicate keys, it must be unique, but the value can be duplicated.
//The Map.Entry is a key and its value combined into one class,which allows you to iterate over Map entrySet() instead of having to iterate over Map.keySet(), then get the value for each key.
//for( Map.Entry<Integer,String> entry : student.entrySet()) { }
//The get(Object key) method will return the value associated with a specified key in this Java hashmap.
//HashMap : HashMap does not maintain the order of its element.
//TreeMap : The natural order of the keys is preserved.
//HashMap is an unordered collection while TreeMap is sorted in the ascending order of its keys.


// Stack 
// java Stack is a LIFO (Last in first out) object.
// Extends the Vector class but supports only five operations.
// he Java stack class only has one constructor that is empty or the default constructor.
// peek() , pop() , push(),search() , Empty()
// Peek() method is used to check the last element of the stack.
// pop() method is always performed on the top of stack element. If we perform pop() operation, it will remove the top element of the stack.
// Search() method returns  1 if it finds the searched element and it returns -1 if it does not find the searched element.


// Queue
// The queue is a data structure that First in First Out(FIFO) structure.
//LinkedBlockingQueue
//LinkedBlockingQueue is of dynamic size. It’s not required to provide size while creating LinkedBlockingQueue.
//add() method is used to add data at the end of the queue
//ArrayBlockingQueue 
//Like Arrays, ArrayBlockingQueue is of fixed size.
//Size of ArrayBlockingQueue should be provided as arguments while creating a queue.
//add() method is used to add data at the end of the queue.
//When the size of the queue is exceeded, it throws IllegalStateException.
//remove()  method removes the first element of the queue. If we try to remove an element from an empty queue, it throws NoSuchElementException.
//element() method returns the first element of the queue. . If we try to examine any empty queue, it throws NoSuchElementException.
// offer() is a special method used for adding data into a queue, which returns true if data is successfully added into a queue and false if data is not added.
//poll()  is a special method that removes the first element of the queue and returns the element which is removed from the queue. If we try to poll any element from an empty queue, it returns null.
//peek() is also a special method that checks for the first element of the queue. It returns null if implemented on an empty queue.

// Dequeue
//This means a DOUBLE ENDED QUEUE.
//The double-ended queue means insertion and deletion can take place from both ends.
//all the Queue methods can be used with Deque, but Deque has its own methods which allow to add and remove elements at the beginning and end of Deque.
//addfirst() , removelast() , offerFirst() , pollFirst()
