// Throws : Throws are used to suppress the error if the user doesn’t want to specify the try and catch block. 
// Note that this doesn’t handle the error only suppresses it. It should be used only when the developer is sure that the error doesn’t occur.

// Throw : The throw is used to forcefully throw an error where it is decided by the developer regarding certain conditions.

// The keyword “throw” is used to throw an exception from any method or static block, 
// while the keyword “throws”, used in a method declaration,indicates what exception can be thrown with this method. They are not interchangeable.
// We can use the keyword throws to delegate the responsibility of handling exceptions to the caller, then the caller method is responsible for handling that exception.

// in below example , in somemethod , exception have thrown with throws and , throws throw it out of the class and its cached in calling method.
//To avoid this compile-time error, we can handle the exception in two ways:
//1)	By using try-catch block
//2) 	By using throws keyword
