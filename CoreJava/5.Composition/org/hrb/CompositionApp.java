// In inheritance, we deal with the attributes of other classes. Composition studies have a relationship in which we ‘inherit’ or use objects from other classes.
// The composition is the design technique to implement has-a relationship between different types of object/classes.
// In inheritance, we can derive some functionality to a subclass of the parent class, in the composition a class reuses the functionality by creating a reference to the object of the class.
// the classes inherit the objects of other classes
// By using composition, we can control the visibility of another object for customer classes and reuse only what we need.
// The composition allows the creation of backend classes when necessary.
