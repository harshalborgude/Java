// Final keyword can be applied to variables, methods, classes, etc
// It is used in various contexts to define an entity that can only be assigned once.
// Once a final variable has been assigned, the variable cannot be changed.
// A variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as a final blank variable. We must initialize the final variable in the constructor of the class, otherwise, it will throw a compilation error.
