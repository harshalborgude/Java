// Abstract classes are created by using the abstract keyword in the class definition.
// An abstract class is used to achieve the abstraction. We can achieve 0 – 100% abstraction by using an abstract.
// An abstract class can have abstract and concrete method both.
// An abstract class cannot be instantiated, it means we cannot create an object of the class. We need a different class for the implementation of the abstract class.
// Note: A class must be an abstract class to contain an abstract method.
//  concrete class (a class which does not contain any abstract method in it) must extend the abstract class to implement the abstract method.As soon as we extend an abstract class, Java displays an error message to implements the abstract method of the class.
