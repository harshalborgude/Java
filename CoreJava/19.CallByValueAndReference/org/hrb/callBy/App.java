package org.hrb.callBy;

// Call by value means to call a method with a parameter as a value. Through this, the value of the argument is passed to the parameter.
// Call by reference means call a method with a parameter as a reference. Through this, argument reference is used to pass the parameter.

// By while passing the value by reference, (such as we pass a pointer to the memory location in C) we can pass the array (which by default passes the address) so that the change can be seen in the variable.
// call by ref is bydefault done.
