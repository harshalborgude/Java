// a class within another class, such classes are known as nested classes
// Nested non-static classes - Non-static classes are an inner class,We know that a class cannot be associated with the private access modifier, but if we have the class as a member of another class, then the inner class can be made private. And this is also used to access private members of a class.
// Static nested classes âˆ’ These are members of a class and declared static are called static nested classes.  It can be accessed without creating an instance of the external class, using other static members. Like static members, a static nested class does not have access to the instance variables and methods of the external class.
