//Linkedlist
//Here, every node is interconnected to the next node through a memory address link.
//This is one of the most useful data structures and highly used in real-world scenarios because of its high-speed capacity and fast addition and deletion. 
//This basic collection structure is the data in and the address which points to the next node functions as the guide of the respective node (That is the reason for it being called the Linked List).
//add() method is used to add data in a newly created linked list.
// remove() method is used to remove the data from the specified location.
