package org.hrb.encapsulation;

// Encapsulation is the process of binding the class members (variables and methods) into a single unit. It protects the data of class to be accessed from outside the class.
// In Encapsulation, we hide the implementation details from the outer class and provided them the controlled access to the class.
// Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring the instance variables as private.However, we can access the private variable through the getter and setter method.
